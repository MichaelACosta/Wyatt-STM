* DONE Clean-up
  CLOSED: [2015-11-04 Wed 15:12]
  - [X] stm
  - [X] channel
  - [X] persistent list
  - [X] exception capture
  - [X] deferred result
* add dll vs static switch in cmake file
  - need to define WSTM_LIBAPI and WSTM_CLASSAPI when in dll mode
* std::list in WTransactionData
  - vector<std::function> would probably be better
  - we coudl use a "small value optimization" with an array, but we're already allocating in std::function so SVO might not help here
* use move semantics in WTransactionData::MergeToParent
* vector of WTransactionData objects instead of linked list?
  - maybe a memory pool instead
* Does VarMap need to hold WVarCoreBase as a shared_ptr?
