* std::list in WTransactionData
  - vector<std::function> would probably be better
  - we coudl use a "small value optimization" with an array, but we're already allocating in std::function so SVO might not help here
* use move semantics in WTransactionData::MergeToParent
* vector of WTransactionData objects instead of linked list?
  - maybe a memory pool instead
* Does VarMap need to hold WVarCoreBase as a shared_ptr?
